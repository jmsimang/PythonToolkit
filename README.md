# PythonToolkit
> This repo contains exercises and code projects written during the Foundation Phase
of the EXPLORE Data Science Academy.

It has files on exploratory analysis using Pandas, advanced Python functions, and some extra notebooks
to make learning Data Science easy.

## data-files
Contains DB extract files from the Cape Town Water Crisis database <br /> and other
dataset files to use during analysis.

## exploratory-analysis
Pandas Data Exploratory analysis done on dam levels, extracted from the Cape Town Water Crisis Database.

## matplotlib
Sample codes used when plotting graphs using **_matplotlib pyplot_**.

## statistics
Combinatorial complexity testing and statistics introduction.

## urllib
**urllib** functionality for reading data of the internet.

The methods can be extended to retrieve non-proprietary site data to use in analysis.

`urllibparse.py` contains code used to perform a GET using *URL encoding* request to a website.
